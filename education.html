            <h3>Why Education Reform?</h3>
            <p>Education is the cornerstone of societal progress. Yet, many children in India lack access to quality education due to various challenges such as economic disparity, geographic isolation, and systemic barriers. Education reform is crucial for bridging these gaps and fostering a more equitable society.</p>
